    """Build a single first-order Trotter step for Hamiltonian simulation.

    This function constructs a Trotter step function that can be used to simulate the
    time  evolution of a quantum system under a given Real Hamiltonian using first-order
    Trotterization. It is constructed by exponentiating each term in the Hamiltonian
    sequentially using the `pauli_exp` function to create the exponentiation circuits
    for each Pauli term. The defaults for `cx_ladder_method` and `rz_method` are set to
    use logarithmic CX ladders and standard RZ gates, respectively.

    Currently, the implementation does not account for global phase factors and thus
    identity terms are stripped from the Hamiltonian. This is because guppy does not
    handle global phase yet. This is fine for Hamiltonian simulation as identity terms
    only contribute a global phase to the evolution, however when doing controlled
    Hamiltonian simulation this will need to be addressed.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python3

        from guppyalgos.algorithms.time_evolution.trotter import trotter_first_order
        import zixy.qubit.pauli as zqp
        n_state_qubits = 4
        hamiltonian = zqp.RealTermSum.from_str("(-0.5, Z0 X1), (-0.1, X0 Z1)")
        trotter_step = trotter_first_order(hamiltonian, n_state_qubits)

    Args:
        hamiltonian (zqp.RealTermSum): The Hamiltonian to simulate, represented as a
        sum of Pauli operators.
        n_state_qubits (int): The number of qubits in the quantum state register.
        cx_ladder (Ladder): CX ladder implementing Ladder protocol.
        rz_method (Callable, optional): Method to implement RZ rotations. Default rz.

    Returns:
        A Guppy function implementing the Trotter step.
