# Phase estimation

## Phase estimation over different register shapes

Canonical phase estimation is a practical example of the same generic-register
pattern. Its essential interface is:

$$
U|\psi\rangle=e^{2\pi i\phi}|\psi\rangle,
\qquad
\mathrm{QPE}(U,|\psi\rangle)\longrightarrow|\widetilde{\phi}\rangle|\psi\rangle.
$$

For three phase qubits, controlled powers imprint the eigenphase before an
inverse QFT converts it into a binary estimate:

```{tikz}
:alt: Three phase qubits start at zero, receive Hadamards, and control U, U squared, and U to the fourth on an eigenstate. An inverse QFT precedes measurement.

\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=0.6cm]
\lstick{$|0\rangle$} & \gate{H} & \ctrl{3} & \qw & \qw & \gate[3]{\mathrm{QFT}^{\dagger}} & \meter{} \\
\lstick{$|0\rangle$} & \gate{H} & \qw & \ctrl{2} & \qw & \qw & \meter{} \\
\lstick{$|0\rangle$} & \gate{H} & \qw & \qw & \ctrl{1} & \qw & \meter{} \\
\lstick{$|\psi\rangle$} & \qw\qwbundle{} & \gate{U} & \gate{U^2} & \gate{U^4} & \qw & \qw
\end{tikzcd}
```

Prepare the Hadamards before calling `qpe`; the function applies the controlled
powers and inverse QFT. A register wire may represent several qubits.

```python
from guppylang import guppy
from guppylang.std.builtins import Function, array, nat
from guppylang.std.quantum import qubit


@guppy
def qpe[n_phase: nat, UnitaryRegs](
    phase_qreg: array[qubit, n_phase],
    unitary_qregs: UnitaryRegs,
    power_oracle: Function[[qubit, UnitaryRegs, int], None],
) -> None:
    ...
```

- `qpe` implements phase estimation without inspecting `unitary_registers`.
- `UnitaryRegs` describes the complete register shape needed by the selected
  unitary implementation.
- The same `UnitaryRegs` appears in the register argument and the oracle
  signature, so Guppy checks that they are compatible.
- Switching algorithms changes the registers and power oracle, not `qpe`.

### Connect Pauli exponentials to QPE

For Trotterized QPE, each controlled $U$ box in the circuit above is one
controlled Trotter step. That step is built from the controlled Pauli
exponentials described in {doc}`trotterised-hamiltonian-simulation`.

```python
from guppylang import guppy
from guppylang.std.builtins import array
from guppylang.std.quantum import qubit
from guppyalgos.algorithms.time_evolution.trotter import cntrl_trotter_first_order

import zixy.qubit.pauli as zqp

hamiltonian = zqp.RealTermSum.from_str(
    "(-0.5, Z0 X1), (-0.1, X0 Z1), (-0.2, Y0 Y1)"
)
n_state_qubits = len(hamiltonian.qubits)
cntrl_trotter_step = cntrl_trotter_first_order(hamiltonian, n_state_qubits)
time_step = 0.1


@guppy
def trotter_power_oracle(
    control: qubit,
    state_qreg: array[qubit, n_state_qubits],
    power: int,
) -> None:
    for _ in range(power):
        cntrl_trotter_step(control, state_qreg, time_step)
```

- A power of $2^k$ repeats the step $2^k$ times under the same phase-qubit control.
- Pass this oracle to `qpe(phase_qreg, state_qreg, trotter_power_oracle)`
  after preparing the phase superposition and the target state.
- The library's dimensionless `time_step` convention gives
  $U_{\mathrm{step}}\approx e^{-i\pi\,\mathrm{time\_step}\,H/2}$.
  Keep that scaling when converting phases to energies.
- Each controlled Pauli exponential uses basis changes, a parity ladder,
  and a controlled rotation. The outer QPE circuit can therefore stay the
  same while the Hamiltonian or gate decomposition changes.

Qubitization needs both a PREPARE register and the target registers used by its
block encoding. They can be grouped into one generic register value:

```python
@guppy.struct
class QubitizationRegs[n_prepare: nat, TargetRegs]:
    prep_qreg: array[qubit, n_prepare]
    target_qregs: TargetRegs


@guppy
def qubitization_power_oracle[n_prepare: nat, TargetRegs](
    control: qubit,
    qregs: QubitizationRegs[n_prepare, TargetRegs],
    power: int,
) -> None:
    for _ in range(power):
        cntrl_walk(control, qregs.prep_qreg, qregs.target_qregs)
```

- Here, `UnitaryRegs` becomes
  `QubitizationRegs[n_prepare, TargetRegs]`.
- `cntrl_walk` applies one controlled qubitization step; the power oracle
  repeats it exactly as the Trotter oracle repeats its controlled step.
- `TargetRegs` can itself be a qubit array, tuple, or Guppy struct, provided the
  controlled walk and power oracle accept the same type.

This keeps phase estimation independent of how the simulated unitary arranges
its state and work registers. See the
{doc}`canonical phase-estimation notebook
<examples/phase_estimation/canonical_phase_estimation>`
for array and struct examples, and the
{doc}`Trotterized phase-estimation notebook
<examples/phase_estimation/zixy_phase_estimation>`
for complete powered-Trotter oracles.

## Qubitized phase estimation

Using the quantum walk constructed in {doc}`block-encoding`,
phase estimation can estimate the walk's eigenphase and convert it back to
an energy. Its target is the **combined preparation and system registers**,
represented by `QubitizationRegs` in the library.

For three phase qubits, the structure is:

```{tikz}
:alt: Three phase qubits receive Hadamards and control walk powers one, two, and four on the combined preparation and system registers. An inverse QFT precedes measurement.

\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=0.6cm]
\lstick{$|0\rangle$} & \gate{H} & \ctrl{3} & \qw & \qw & \gate[3]{\mathrm{QFT}^{\dagger}} & \meter{} \\
\lstick{$|0\rangle$} & \gate{H} & \qw & \ctrl{2} & \qw & \qw & \meter{} \\
\lstick{$|0\rangle$} & \gate{H} & \qw & \qw & \ctrl{1} & \qw & \meter{} \\
\lstick{$|0^a\rangle|E\rangle$} & \qw\qwbundle{} & \gate{W} & \gate{W^2} & \gate{W^4} & \qw & \qw
\end{tikzcd}
```

- Prepare the phase register with Hadamards **before** calling `qpe`.
  The library's `qpe` applies controlled powers and the inverse QFT.
- `qubitized_power_oracle` repeats the controlled walk for the requested
  integer power. With $m$ phase qubits, this uses $2^m-1$ walk steps.
- A Hamiltonian eigenstate with a zero preparation register generally overlaps
  both walk eigenstates. The two conjugate phases encode the same energy.
- Energy-sampling probabilities depend on the input's eigenstate overlaps;
  QPE does not itself prepare the ground state.

### Decode the sampled phase

The repository's `binary_fraction` helper expresses the phase in half-turns:
$W|\omega\rangle=e^{i\pi\phi}|\omega\rangle$, with $0\leq\phi<2$.
Thus $\phi$ is twice the turn-based phase used in the opening QPE equation.

$$
E=-\lambda\cos(\pi\phi),
\qquad
\phi\ \text{and}\ 2-\phi\ \text{give the same }E.
$$

The helper `phase_to_energy_qubitized_qpe(phi, data.l1_norm)` implements
this conversion. For example, $H=(X+Z)/2$ has normalization $\lambda=1$.
Its positive eigenvalue $1/\sqrt{2}$ produces half-turn phases $3/4$ and
$5/4$, both exactly representable with three phase qubits.

The {doc}`qubitized phase-estimation notebook
<examples/phase_estimation/qubitized_phase_estimation>` demonstrates the
larger Hamiltonian

$$
H=0.5Z_0X_1Y_2+0.1X_0Z_1Z_2+0.2Y_0Y_1X_2+0.3X_0X_1Y_2.
$$

It combines `LCUData`, `build_cntrl_unary_iteration_select`,
`QubitizationCntrl`, and `qpe`, then compares sampled energies with exact
diagonalization. Its five-qubit phase register has grid spacing $2/2^5$.
Exact eigenstate preparation is used there as a small-system validation tool.
